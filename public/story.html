        <h4 class="pad2 white1">Tim Chancery and Dale McBivens met while working summer jobs in Yellowstone back in ... well, that doesn't really matter. What matters is their friendship forged by their love of the outdoors. </h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">Tim and Dale hiked every chance they got. Weekends, before their shifts, after their shifts, and sometimes even <em>during</em> thier shifts. They were out in the backcountry every chance they got.</h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">And then Dale got his first mountain bike. </h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">It was all about the mountain biking the next summer when he reunited with Tim. After all, if Dale had a bike, Dale had to have one, too. Tim worked hard the firs 3 weeks, picking up as many shifts as he could. Before he knew it, he had one of his own.</h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">And they were off! Hitting every trail they could find. When they started repeating trails, they went to the Grand Tetons to start down there. </h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">And so they went for another summer before graduating college. By then they knew they were hooked. They couldn't take desk jobs in New York or Chicago. They had to be out there in the wilds of America. So they took the plunge.</h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">Tim asked his dad for a small loan to start his own company with Dale in order to guide tourists around Yellowstone.All they had was a van, a small office and whatever gear they could scrounge up. It wasn't glamourous, but thier customers soon realized that these 2 young men knew more about Yellostone and the Grand Tetons than any other company out there. Their enthusiasm was contagious and their customers kept returning and bringing friends. </h4>
        <h4 class="pad2 white1">And from there, as they say, the rest is history!</h4>
